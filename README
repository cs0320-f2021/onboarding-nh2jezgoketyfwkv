Onboarding Project
Members: csims
Project Description: The goal of the project is to be able to parse a csv file containing star's names and x, y, z
positions. Using this data, you can search for its k nearest neighbors

Design Choices: For csv parsing, I split each line read into strings. I then stored these strings inside a two
dimensional list.

The nearest neighbors algorithm uses method overloading. There are two ways to find nearest neighbors.
One way utilizes coordinates and the other utilizes a star's name. If we know the name of the star, then we search
the data to find that stars coordinates. Using these coordinates we calculate the distance between these coordinates
and every other star. We put every stars' coordinates in a hashmap so that after we sort the distances, we can get the
name of the star corresponding to this distance

Tests
I wasn't sure how to handle JUnit testing for console output, so I wasn't able to write JUnit tests for the nearest
neighbors algorithm. However, I was able to write tests for the CSVParser. The first test checks that every column
is parsed correctly. The second test randomly selects 100 numbers and asserts that the starID is the expected value.
